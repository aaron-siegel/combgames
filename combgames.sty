% TODO:  option to rotate (particularly for, say, Hackenbush strings)
%        make the dottedline settable?  i.e., dotted=[linestyle=dashed,dash=1.5pt 1.5pt]
% Exploit \newpsstyle and \newpsobject
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% BUG:  Haven't figured out how to insert the appropriate \uppercase
% BUG:  Under certain conditions ^ in domineering is not matched.  Don't know why,
%       so I suspect other subtle logic problems having to do with catcodes.
%       (Problem appears in math mode, but disappears in a \Game.)
% BUG:  Two ^'s in a row cause a poblem for \domineering
% BUG:  SCOPING SLIGHTLY STRANGE.  For instance, \gridgameset obliterates a previous \gridgameset.
